# CKAN Docker

*CKAN and friends running in Docker with the DCAT harvesting extension*

## Usage

Theoretically this is all going work with a single `docker-compose up` command. At that point you should be able to visit `localhost:5000` and have CKAN with all the harvesting bells and whistles running.

## TODO

- Figure out how to deal with the background processes
